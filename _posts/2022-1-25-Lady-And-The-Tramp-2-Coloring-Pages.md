This post is about Lady And The Tramp 2 Coloring Pages. The sequel to the 1955 film Lady and the Tramp, follows their son Scamp as he longs for life on the street instead of in the home. Like The Little Mermaid II, this movie has a similar plot to the original, just in reverse. Also like that film, it is very formulaic in plot and music. The animation here is well done and one of the best animated direct to home video sequels by DisneyToon Studios. The voice acting also stands out here with Alyssa Milano voicing Angel, the love interest, Jodi Benson taking over for Lady and Jeff Bennett voicing several characters including Tramp, Jock, Trusty and a really good Don Knotts impression for the dog catcher. I didn’t agree with the creative choice to show the human’s faces, as the original was seen from the dog’s perspective and this movie was not. This made it feel like it wasn’t in the same world we saw before. The music is forgettable at best, though I did feel that there was potential there, just not realized. If you enjoyed the first movie and plot interests you, then this movie might be worth a watch [Source: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249677/]
